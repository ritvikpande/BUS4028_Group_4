Airbnb, Inc is an American company that operates an online marketplace for lodging, primarily homestays for vacation rentals, and tourism activities. Based in San Francisco, California, the platform is accessible via website and mobile app. Airbnb does not own any of the listed properties; instead, it profits by receiving commission from each booking. The company was founded in 2008. Airbnb is a shortened version of its original name, AirBedandBreakfast.com.

Key tasks in this assignment include data cleaning (handling missing values and duplicates), reshaping, filtering, and feature engineering. We also performed summary statistics, correlation analysis, and visualized trends using scatter plots and bar plots. Additionally, a user-defined function was implemented, and a training set was created for future modeling. 
This repository contains the full R script, an .RMD report, and visual outputs.
